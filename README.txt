Tube Man Boxing - README
-------------------------

'Tube Man Boxing' is a cartoon boxing game I am currently developing for iOS. A friend has contributed the music.
I started work on this project in my spare time during university holidays (June-July 2012) and 
have since continued work on the project after completing my degree in November.

Through this game I am trying to bring combo-driven fighting mechanics to the iOS platform, as I have not found 
a fighting game which replicates the gameplay I enjoyed as a kid in games such as Street Fighter. This is because 
the touchscreen interface is not designed to accomodate these kind of mechanics. Using tube men as characters is an elegant 
solution, as players do not need to move around the screen - they can attack or deflate themselves to dodge attacks. This 
allows the game to stay focused on the combo and special attacks executed by players experimenting with their character.

Features
------------------------
-Character Select - 8 original characters to select from with individual play-styles and special attacks
-Arcade ladder mode - battle increasingly difficult AI characters
-Controls/tutorial screens
-Practice mode - enemy AI is turned off
-Pause game
-Randomised backgrounds - boxing ring, bar, back of a truck etc
-Multiplayer - in development using iOS Game Center. The alpha version works although I will need to set up a Python server to sync 
				the gameplay correctly.
-Unlockable moves - I am considering adding a currency system where players accumulate coins for completing matches.
					The coins could then be spent on unlocking extra content in the game.
